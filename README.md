# Course-system-with-GUI-and-DB
Continuation of my console based course system but this time it was done with JavaFX and with a database (mysql)

**KNOWN BUGS**
Duplicated info in "My Courses" form (probably shit SQL code)

# For people who want to try it out
Download XAMPP and start it, then download the .sql file and import, to look at the inside of the DB go to http://localhost/phpmyadmin<br/>
for the code itself, just click compile when you load the project
